print(round(x)),    3  rounds the number
print(abs(-2.9))    2.9 'absolute' always gives a positive number
print(math.ceil(2.9) 3 ceiling is giving the next value up.
print(math.floor(2.9) 2 floor is giving the next value down
Order of operation are:
(10 + 3) * 2 ** 2 = 52
parenthesis
exponentiation
multiplication or division
